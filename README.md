To elucidate the role of post-translational modifications (PTM) stoichiometry in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein’s 3D folding and interaction with ACE2, we generated a high-resolution quantitative map of 87 PTMs on spike protein from LC-MS/MS analysis, and then reconstitute the spike protein structure to reveals heterogeneity caused by PTMs. Nonetheless, Alphafold2, an atomic accuracy AI tool to perform protein structure prediction, relies solely on protein primary sequences and whereas the impact of PTM, which often modulate critical protein folding and functions, are much ignored. In this study, we proposed the first innovative “mutagenesis” approach: the in-silico amino-acid substitution to mimic the altered physicochemical properties of PTM sites, and then reconstitute the spike protein structure using Alphafold2. Furthermore, the ACE2 host factor interaction that target the RBD area were also examined and evaluated for binding to the different PTM modified in-silico SARS-CoV-2 structures. The proposed methods identify unique spike protein structures that contribute to understand the role of PTM in protein structure, a problem that Alphafold2 has yet to address. Mechanistically, this study suggests that the post-translationally modified protein structural analyses via mutagenesis and deep learning exist. The reconstructed spike protein structures show that specific PTMs can be used to modulate host factor binding, guide antibody design, and pave the way for new therapeutic targets.
